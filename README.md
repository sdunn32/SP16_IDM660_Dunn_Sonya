This README.MD file is related to MCAD's Spring 2016 Responsive Design IDM Course 6660
In a nutshell, Responsive Design is an emerging web design paradigm that allows for the 
same web site or web application to dynamically rearrange and redesign its content based 
on the size of the viewing environment. There is no browser detection or redirect scripts 
in a truly responsive design. Rather, the site reconstitutes itself to fit in the browsing 
environment.
